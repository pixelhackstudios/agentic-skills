description: Write spec-driven prompts for an image-generation model producing static UI mockups, concept boards, or design comps at a fixed canvas size. Covers prompt skeletons, one-variable-at-a-time variation, negative prompts, and a two-pass workflow that typesets real text separately. Use only when the deliverable is a generated image; do not use when building an actual web interface in code.

# Design-First UI Prompting Skill

This skill is for **prompting an image-generation model** to produce static UI mockups and concept imagery at a
fixed canvas size.

> **Boundary — do not use this skill to build a real interface.** Its output is a prompt for an image model,
> not markup, styles, or components. When the deliverable is a working web surface, the applicable skills are
> `visual-design` for the specification, [`web-design/README.md`](../../web-design/README.md) for craft
> selection, and `frontend-development` for implementation. The typography guidance here is calibrated for
> image generation (where models misspell text and text is often typeset in a second pass), not for the web.

## Core principle
**Prompt like a design system, not a wish.**

## Prompt Structure (copy/paste)
Use this skeleton, then fill the blanks.

```text
GOAL
- What are we making? (e.g., landing page hero / onboarding / dashboard / carousel slide)
- Who is it for? (persona)
- What’s the success criteria? (clarity, conversion, vibe)

FORMAT
- Size/aspect: (e.g., 1080x1350)
- Safe margins: (e.g., 90px)

LAYOUT (wireframe in words)
- Grid: (e.g., Swiss 6-col)
- Placement: (e.g., type-left / image-right)
- Hierarchy: H1 → subhead → body → CTA

TYPE SYSTEM
- Font vibe: (e.g., Söhne / Neue Haas / SF Pro)
- Weights: (H1 700, body 400)
- Leading: (tight for H1, readable for body)
- Tracking: (micro labels wider)

COLOR + MATERIAL
- Background: (hex or description)
- Text: (white/ivory/charcoal)
- One accent only: (cyan/lime/purple)
- Texture: (subtle grain, no plastic HDR)

IMAGERY / UI STYLE
- UI style: (minimal / glass / editorial / playful 3D)
- If photo: lighting + crop + texture rules
- If 3D: materials + lighting + softness

COPY (render EXACTLY)
- Line 1:
- Line 2:
- ...

CONSTRAINTS (change 1–2 things only)
- FONT: ___
- STYLE: ___
- MODE: ___

NEGATIVE PROMPT
- No logos, no watermarks
- No extra text beyond provided lines
- No gibberish typography
```

## Rules that improve consistency

### 1) Lock one “system”, then iterate with variants
- First output: nail **layout + hierarchy + copy**.
- Variants: change **ONE variable** at a time:
  - angle / crop
  - accent color
  - card arrangement
  - background tone

### 2) Treat typography as fragile
If the model keeps misspelling:
- Use **2-pass workflow**:
  1) Generate without text (reserve a clean text-safe area)
  2) Typeset in Figma

### 3) Use “constraints cards”
When you want the model to obey a style:
- Add a small “Constraints” panel with explicit values.
- It anchors the output like a mini style guide.

Example:
```text
Constraints
FONT  CANELA
STYLE  MINIMAL
MODE  DARK
```

### 4) Keep a local reference pack
Don’t ask the model to “remember” taste.
- Save references into a gitignored local reference folder, such as `refs/...`
- Point prompts to the reference style

## Fast iteration checklist (what to tweak)
- Spacing: margins, leading, baseline rhythm
- Contrast: background vs text
- Hierarchy: one hero line, one support line
- One accent only (don’t rainbow)
- Texture: add grain, remove smoothing

## Questions to ask (when user is vague)
- What’s the single message of this screen?
- What’s the hierarchy (H1 / sub / CTA)?
- Which style lane: minimal editorial vs playful 3D vs glass UI?
- Any must-keep constraints (font vibe, color, spacing, grid)?
