# Web Design Capability Skills

Capability skills for web visual design, motion, 3D, layout, and interaction technique.

These are **capability skills**, not framework skills. They supply technique and direction; they do not own
authority. Product behaviour remains `product-design`'s, the expressive thesis `creative-direction`'s, the
exact visual specification `visual-design`'s, exact wording `ux-writing`'s and `copywriting`'s, and the
independent verdict `testing-and-verification`'s. See
[`skill-authoring-standard`](../skill-authoring-standard/SKILL.md) for the class distinction.

## How to select

**Load the narrowest skill that covers the request.** These skills are additive, not comprehensive — three
technique skills applied to one page is normal; three direction skills is incoherent.

Precedence, in order:

1. **At most one `direction` skill per project.** Directions are whole-page visual systems and they contradict
   each other by design. If two seem to fit, the request is under-specified — resolve it with
   `creative-direction` before picking one, or pick neither and let the thesis drive the visual system.
2. **At most one `archetype` skill per page.** Archetypes carry page structure and section sequence.
3. **`technique` skills combine freely.** They own one mechanism each and are meant to be composed.
4. **`library` skills load on demand**, when the project actually uses that library.
5. **Prefer a `technique` skill over a `direction` skill** when the request names a specific effect. "Add a
   word-by-word headline reveal" is a technique request even inside an editorial project.
6. **A direction skill is a starting point, not a specification.** It does not replace `visual-design`'s
   specification or `creative-direction`'s thesis, and adopting one wholesale produces the interchangeable
   result those skills exist to prevent. Where a direction skill and an approved thesis disagree, the thesis
   governs.

## Page archetypes — structure and section sequence

Pick at most one. Each carries a page structure, not just a look.

| The page is | Use |
|---|---|
| A single-offer conversion page for SaaS, an app, or a service | [`landing-page`](landing-page/SKILL.md) |
| A SaaS pricing page with plans, comparison, and FAQ | [`pricing-page`](pricing-page/SKILL.md) |
| A SaaS/AI product page where a real workflow or demo is the proof | [`product-proof-saas`](product-proof-saas/SKILL.md) |
| An enterprise AI/automation/security page explaining boundaries, approvals, and auditability | [`operational-enterprise-ai`](operational-enterprise-ai/SKILL.md) |
| A creative studio, agency, photographer, or artist portfolio led by project work | [`editorial-portfolio-chapters`](editorial-portfolio-chapters/SKILL.md) |
| An agency/production/architecture/culture site with billboard type and hard chapters | [`documentary-brutalist-agency`](documentary-brutalist-agency/SKILL.md) |
| An appointment-based service site (salon, spa, clinic, hospitality) | [`editorial-service-booking`](editorial-service-booking/SKILL.md) |
| A long-form story, case study, or article rebuilt as a scroll-driven journey | [`scroll-world-storytelling`](scroll-world-storytelling/SKILL.md) |
| A cinematic scroll-driven landing page with sticky stacks and scrubbed transitions | [`cinematic-scroll-storytelling`](cinematic-scroll-storytelling/SKILL.md) |
| An ambitious motion-led marketing, editorial, or portfolio site, art direction included | [`build-awwwards-quality-sites`](build-awwwards-quality-sites/SKILL.md) |
| One continuous 3D world the reader travels through across chapters | [`build-threejs-scroll-worlds`](build-threejs-scroll-worlds/SKILL.md) |

`build-awwwards-quality-sites` is the broadest entry here: it art-directs *and* implements, and it names the
other capability skills it expects to combine with. Reach for it when the request is for ambition rather than a
specific page type. Reach for a narrower archetype when the page type is the request.

## Visual directions — whole-page visual systems

**Pick at most one.** Grouped by family; skills within a family are close neighbours and are candidates for
consolidation (see [Known overlaps](#known-overlaps)).

| Family | Skills |
|---|---|
| Editorial / minimal | [`agency-grid-layout-minimal`](agency-grid-layout-minimal/SKILL.md), [`clean-minimal-beige-light-mode`](clean-minimal-beige-light-mode/SKILL.md), [`book-serif-index`](book-serif-index/SKILL.md), [`image-first-grid-layout`](image-first-grid-layout/SKILL.md), [`editorial-tech`](editorial-tech/SKILL.md) |
| Dark glass | [`dark-glass-clean-layout`](dark-glass-clean-layout/SKILL.md), [`blue-laser-clean-glass-layout`](blue-laser-clean-glass-layout/SKILL.md), [`glass-dark-mode-clock`](glass-dark-mode-clock/SKILL.md) |
| Technical / framed | [`framed-tech-dark-border-gradient`](framed-tech-dark-border-gradient/SKILL.md), [`light-mode-paper-technical`](light-mode-paper-technical/SKILL.md), [`technical-wireframe-info-layout`](technical-wireframe-info-layout/SKILL.md), [`split-layout-technical`](split-layout-technical/SKILL.md), [`funky-purple-container-tech`](funky-purple-container-tech/SKILL.md), [`bright-green-tech-system-webgl`](bright-green-tech-system-webgl/SKILL.md) |
| Dark atmospheric | [`dither-laser-dark-mode`](dither-laser-dark-mode/SKILL.md), [`mesh-gradient-dark-blue-clean`](mesh-gradient-dark-blue-clean/SKILL.md), [`dark-blue-contrasting-clean`](dark-blue-contrasting-clean/SKILL.md), [`tech-green-dark-mode-modern`](tech-green-dark-mode-modern/SKILL.md) |
| Light / product | [`orange-clean-paper-saas`](orange-clean-paper-saas/SKILL.md), [`blue-cloudy-clean-modern`](blue-cloudy-clean-modern/SKILL.md), [`nested-container-clean-agency`](nested-container-clean-agency/SKILL.md) |
| Skeuomorphic | [`high-contrast-skeuomorphic-clean`](high-contrast-skeuomorphic-clean/SKILL.md) |
| Cinematic motion-led | [`cinematic-gsap-lenis-motion-system`](cinematic-gsap-lenis-motion-system/SKILL.md) |

> **Quality caveat.** Most skills in this section currently describe their target in adjectives rather than
> constants, and none yet satisfies the Integration Contract's
> [Operational Constants](../skill-authoring-standard/SKILL.md) requirement. Treat them as mood references, not
> as specifications: they tell you where to aim, not what to set. Derive actual values from `visual-design`'s
> specification. Consolidation and rewrite are tracked in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Motion and scroll

| The need | Use |
|---|---|
| General motion principles, easing and duration defaults, choreography | [`animation-systems`](animation-systems/SKILL.md) |
| GSAP API, timelines, ScrollTrigger, React integration, plugins, performance | The [`gsap-*` family](../gsap-core/SKILL.md) — `gsap-core`, `gsap-timeline`, `gsap-scrolltrigger`, `gsap-react`, `gsap-plugins`, `gsap-utils`, `gsap-performance` |
| Reveal elements as they enter the viewport, no GSAP dependency | [`animation-on-scroll`](animation-on-scroll/SKILL.md) |
| Headline reveals word-by-word through a hard mask edge, on entry | [`masked-reveal`](masked-reveal/SKILL.md) |
| Headline words fade and rise on entry, no mask, no GSAP | [`staggered-word-reveal`](staggered-word-reveal/SKILL.md) |
| Reading progress follows scroll position continuously and reverses | [`scroll-scrubbed-word-reveal`](scroll-scrubbed-word-reveal/SKILL.md) |
| A pinned stage whose visual transforms forward and backward with scroll | [`scroll-scrubbed-visual-sequence`](scroll-scrubbed-visual-sequence/SKILL.md) |
| An ordered process rendered as a progress-tracked timeline | [`scroll-progress-timeline`](scroll-progress-timeline/SKILL.md) |
| Sticky product storytelling with progressive UI reveals | [`gsap-scrolltrigger-storytelling`](gsap-scrolltrigger-storytelling/SKILL.md) |
| A seamless infinite marquee | [`marquee-loop`](marquee-loop/SKILL.md) |

**Smooth scroll:** choose exactly one engine and never initialize two. Default to **ScrollSmoother** when GSAP
is already the animation system — it is free, shares ScrollTrigger's measurement pass, and adds no dependency
(see [`gsap-plugins`](../gsap-plugins/SKILL.md)). Use **Lenis** when smooth scroll is needed without GSAP, or
when a Lenis integration already exists.

## Backgrounds and atmosphere

Composable. Keep the count low — a page needs one atmospheric layer, not four.

| The effect | Use |
|---|---|
| Drifting vertical light folds with a concentrated bloom | [`atmosphere-background`](atmosphere-background/SKILL.md) |
| Perspective WebGL grid receding with parallax | [`background-grid-webgl`](background-grid-webgl/SKILL.md) |
| Bayer-style ordered dither field, near-black, organic wave masses | [`dither-background`](dither-background/SKILL.md) |
| Corner-anchored laser beams with a bright emitter node | [`corner-lasers`](corner-lasers/SKILL.md) |
| Full-screen vertical laser core with halo and fog | [`webgl-laser`](webgl-laser/SKILL.md) |
| Merging organic blobs via SVG filter threshold | [`gooey-blob-system`](gooey-blob-system/SKILL.md) |
| Configurable ambient motes bounded to one section | [`ambient-section-particles`](ambient-section-particles/SKILL.md) |
| Falling shapes that must read as a recognisable object (leaves, petals) | [`falling-leaves`](falling-leaves/SKILL.md) |
| Drop-in animated WebGL backgrounds from a library | [`vantajs`](vantajs/SKILL.md) |
| A hosted interactive animation embed | [`unicorn-studio`](unicorn-studio/SKILL.md) |

`ambient-section-particles` owns generic motes; `falling-leaves` owns particles whose *shape must be
recognisable*. Choose by whether the silhouette carries meaning.

## Pointer and hover interaction

| The effect | Use |
|---|---|
| A mote trail whose spacing stays constant at any hand speed | [`pointer-trail-emitter`](pointer-trail-emitter/SKILL.md) |
| A halftone/twinkle cursor trail rendered in WebGPU | [`add-shader-cursor-trail`](add-shader-cursor-trail/SKILL.md) |
| Fluid ripple distortion following the cursor over an image | [`shaders-cursor-ripples`](shaders-cursor-ripples/SKILL.md) |
| A cursor-following spotlight revealing a second aligned image | [`reveal-hover-effect`](reveal-hover-effect/SKILL.md) |

## Layout structure and surface detail

| The need | Use |
|---|---|
| Thin visible boundary lines with L-shaped corner brackets | [`framed-grid-layout`](framed-grid-layout/SKILL.md) |
| Container-in-container nesting with layered frames | [`nested-container-frames`](nested-container-frames/SKILL.md) |
| Vertical container-width guide lines with corner squares | [`container-lines`](container-lines/SKILL.md) |
| Diagonal-cut / chamfered corners on controls and panels | [`corner-diagonals`](corner-diagonals/SKILL.md) |
| Gradient border edges on cards, nav, modals | [`css-border-gradient`](css-border-gradient/SKILL.md) |
| Layered neutral elevation via exact Tailwind shadow utilities | [`beautiful-shadows`](beautiful-shadows/SKILL.md) |
| Edge fades using mask-image gradients | [`css-alpha-masking`](css-alpha-masking/SKILL.md) |
| Stepped backdrop-blur fading from a viewport edge | [`progressive-blur`](progressive-blur/SKILL.md) |
| Frosted dark-mode glass surfaces with readable contrast | [`glass-dark-ui`](glass-dark-ui/SKILL.md) |
| Pressed, carved, tactile physical surface styling | [`skeuomorphic-ui`](skeuomorphic-ui/SKILL.md) |
| Decorative 01/02/03 numeric section markers | [`number-details`](number-details/SKILL.md) |

`framed-grid-layout`, `nested-container-frames`, and `container-lines` are close neighbours: the first owns
bracketed section boundaries, the second owns nested inset shells, the third owns width guide lines. Pick by
which line is actually visible in the intended result.

## 3D and WebGL

| The need | Use |
|---|---|
| Three.js scene, camera, materials, loaders, disposal | [`threejs`](threejs/SKILL.md) |
| A faceted 3D hero object with real lighting | [`webgl-3d-object`](webgl-3d-object/SKILL.md) |
| A luminous particle globe with an orbital ring | [`globe-particles`](globe-particles/SKILL.md) |
| A data globe with points, arcs, polygons, labels | [`globe-gl`](globe-gl/SKILL.md) |
| A lightweight interactive globe, minimal setup | [`cobejs`](cobejs/SKILL.md) |
| 2D physics bodies and constraints | [`matterjs`](matterjs/SKILL.md) |
| Steering a WebGL-heavy landing page toward a visual outcome | [`webgl-landing-steering`](webgl-landing-steering/SKILL.md) |

`globe-particles` renders a synthesized particle sphere; `globe-gl` and `cobejs` render a geographic globe with
data layers. Choose by whether the sphere carries real geography.

## Components, assets, and libraries

| The need | Use |
|---|---|
| Tailwind layout, theming, responsive and state variants | [`tailwindcss`](tailwindcss/SKILL.md) |
| shadcn/ui components, registries, composition | [`shadcn`](../shadcn/SKILL.md) |
| Animated edge-glow states on cards, buttons, tabs | [`beam-glow-states`](beam-glow-states/SKILL.md) |
| Animated liquid-metal borders (React `metal-fx`) | [`liquid-metal-border`](liquid-metal-border/SKILL.md) |
| AI/agent activity indicators replacing a generic spinner | [`thinking-orbs`](thinking-orbs/SKILL.md) |
| Real company logos as icons rather than text | [`company-logos`](company-logos/SKILL.md) |
| Solar Duotone Bold icon style | [`solar-duotone-bold`](solar-duotone-bold/SKILL.md) |
| Stock photography for backgrounds, portraits, avatars | [`unsplash-asset-images`](../media/unsplash-asset-images/SKILL.md), [`aura-asset-images`](../media/aura-asset-images/SKILL.md) |

**On stock imagery:** legitimate for backgrounds, textures, and real avatar photography where no original asset
exists. Not legitimate as a substitute for a concept, as decorative filler, or as fabricated proof —
`build-awwwards-quality-sites` and `visual-design` both prohibit those uses, and neither is relaxed by the
existence of a sourcing skill.

## Known overlaps

Recorded so an agent can route around them, not yet consolidated. Where two skills overlap, prefer the one whose
stated mechanism matches the request; if neither is clearly closer, prefer the one carrying real constants.

- **`gsap`** is superseded by the seven `gsap-*` skills, which are current and cross-linked. Prefer those; the
  local `gsap` skill remains only for its short recipe list and its cleanup advice is out of date (see its own
  header note).
- **`masked-reveal` / `staggered-word-reveal`** describe near-identical effects with materially different
  constants. Distinguished above by mask edge and GSAP dependency.
- **Scroll storytelling** — `cinematic-scroll-storytelling`, `gsap-scrolltrigger-storytelling`,
  `scroll-world-storytelling`, and `build-threejs-scroll-worlds` overlap substantially. Distinguished above by
  output: page archetype, sticky product section, article transformation, and continuous 3D world respectively.
- **Direction families** — skills within each family row above are close neighbours; the row is the routing
  unit until consolidation.
- **`animation-systems` / `cinematic-gsap-lenis-motion-system`** both define motion systems; the first is
  library-agnostic principles, the second is a GSAP+Lenis cinematic direction.

## Adding a skill here

Follow [`skill-authoring-standard`](../skill-authoring-standard/SKILL.md)'s Capability Skill Integration
Contract, and for a `technique` skill, [`web-technique-to-skill`](../codex/web-technique-to-skill/SKILL.md).
Add the routing entry in the same change — an unrouted skill competes for activation on description text alone
and will be selected arbitrarily against its siblings.
